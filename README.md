## Description
<p align="justify">
Using the GeoJSON from The United States Geological Survey (USGS), this javascript creates a visual displaying earthquake depth and magnitude on a world map. 
Earthquake data above Richter magnitude 4.5 from the past 7 days is used to create a marked world map<a href="https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/4.5_week.geojson"><b>[1]</b></a><br>. 
Colour and size of the markers are used to distinguish earthquake depth and size respectively, with tooltips displaying the information on-click. 
This tool is intended to be straightforward to use; requirements are only to download the files and 
open in a web browser, so that anyone can use it.
